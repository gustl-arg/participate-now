# Fermat Frequently Asked Questions!

We have compiled the most frequently asked questions about Fermat. 

## What is Fermat?

### Fermat is a P2P Network, a Framework and a System of Integrated APPs:

The Fermat P2P Network interconnects mobile phones among each other in order to exchange application data without needing to go through a centralized service.

The Fermat Framework is like WordPress, but it runs on a mobile device or desktop computer instead of a server. Except that it is not intended for building web sites, but for building applications that need to hold large amounts of digital value at the end userâ€™s device.

The System of Integrated APPs offers different products to end users. From the outside it looks like a set of mobile APPs targeting different use cases for different people, but on the inside there is an integrated system built with thousands of components collaborating among each other. These APPs are just the user interfaces, or skins of the underlying mechanisms. 

Fermat's main goal is to decentralize the full stack up to the user interface.

## What is the difference between Fermat and Counterparty?

* Counterparty is a protocol that adds some nice functionalities on top of bitcoin; Implemented as a p2p network of nodes running this extended functionalities. It also has a client software and an applications ecosystem built on top of this infrastructure.

* Fermat p2p network does not have any financial functionality at all. It does not extend bitcoins functionalities in any way either. Its purpose is just to interconnect devices in order to exchange any kind of meta-data.

* Fermat Framework does not have any financial functionalities either. Its purpose is to host _Decentralized Financial Applications_ built with Plug-ins. The framework provides access to any crypto network to allow apps to transport value, and to the Fermat network to transport meta-data.

* The Fermat Framework hosts a stack of _Platforms_ on top of it. Each platform adds a layer after layer of functionalities to the whole system.

So the answer to this question would be that the Fermat and Counterparty Architectures are totally different. Fermat is higher on the stack and might have a Plug-in to consume counterparty services and expose these services to other Plug-ins within the Fermat Framework.

## What are the similarities between Fermat and Counterparty?

At counterparty you have a decentralized exchange, as well as the ability to create virtual assets, issue dividends, create price feeds and bets, and create smart contracts, all this at a protocol level and implemented on their p2p network.

Fermat might implement some of this functionalities but run them at a totally different level on the stack: at the end user's devices. In some cases it might use a propietary implementation and in some others it might reuse Counterparty, Ethereum, Rootstock or other lower level service providers to do so.
